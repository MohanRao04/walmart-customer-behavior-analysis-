ðŸŒŸWalmart Sales Data Internship â€” Week 1 Storyâ€¦â€¦.

This week, my main focus was on **understanding the business problem** we are trying to solve. 
First, I started by asking myself the big question: 

"What do we want to understand from this data?" 

ðŸ‘‰Based on my observations, we want to study customer buying behavior at Walmart â€” like 
which products sell the most, which cities bring more revenue, whether customers are happy 
(ratings), and if Walmart members spend more than regular customers. 
Next, I thought from the stakeholders' point of view â€” 

Who will use these insights? 

ðŸ‘‰Store managers, marketing teams, and customer experience managers. 
I imagined what they might want to know, such as: 
  â€¢ Why are sales increasing or decreasing? 
  â€¢ Which products or cities are performing best? 
  â€¢ Where should Walmart invest more? 
  â€¢ How to improve customer satisfaction? 

After that, I defined the goals and KPIs clearly. 
The business goals are to: 
  â€¢ Increase total revenue 
  â€¢ Improve customer satisfaction (ratings) 
  â€¢ Find top and bottom performers in cities and products 
  â€¢ Understand member vs non-member spending

The KPIs I set to track progress are: 
  â€¢ Total Revenue 
  â€¢ Average Customer Rating 
  â€¢ Best and Least Performing Cities 
  â€¢ Top-Selling Product Line 
  â€¢ Member vs Non-Member Spend Comparison 

Finally, I framed smart hypotheses â€” these are assumptions we'll check with data later: 
  â€¢ Revenue might be dropping in some cities. 
  â€¢ Members may spend more than non-members. 
  â€¢ Fashion accessories could be the most profitable. 
  â€¢ Higher ratings might lead to more sales.
